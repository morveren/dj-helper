# DJ helper ðŸ”‰ ðŸ’¿

This repo aims to make collecting and organising your tracks a little easier.

## How to use this repo


1. Populate the .env file with the folders where you import your music to and the one you keep it in (see `.env_example for details on variables)
2. Install Docker
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal

that's basically it...the app will run in the background and migrate music that gets dumped into your selected folders
